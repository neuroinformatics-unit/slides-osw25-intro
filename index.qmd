## Hacking tips {.smaller}

Everyone gets opportunity to contribute

* Be flexible and inclusive
* Code is not the only thing that needs doing
* Planning, documenting, organizing, presenting, reading, time-keeping…

Working together

* Start by introducing yourself, your work and your skills to the group
* Make use of GitHub, Shared google doc
* Keep in touch with the group throughout

Look after yourself

* Take breaks, stretch, rest your eyes
* Enjoy

## Hacking tips {.smaller}

* Settle on doable plan

Things will go wrong – that’s OK!

* Work incrementally and version-control your work
* You have a very short amount of time!
* Focus on minimum viable "product"

Report back in short lightning presentations at 4 PM [(joint slide-deck)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-4tv1ZKLjbLAY7IUUaeSmc6_KXqrsDXM9DAFLH8UqiA/edit?usp=sharing)

* What you did
* What you learnt
* Future work

We will check in regularly
